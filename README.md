# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This consists of a Convolutional Neural Network that I developed and deployed to carry out the classification of thousands of
handwritten digits that I acquired from the MNIST Database, using the Tensorflow.js Layers API. I monitored the in-browser training of
the CNN model using the Tensorflow.js Vis API. The model was trained using 55,000 images.
